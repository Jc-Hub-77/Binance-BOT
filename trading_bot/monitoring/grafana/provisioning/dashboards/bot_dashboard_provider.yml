providers:
  - name: 'BotDashboards' # A uniquely identifiable name for the provider
    orgId: 1 # Default organization ID
    folder: 'Trading Bot' # Optional: name of the folder to GPLOAD dashboards to.
    folderUid: '' # Optional: unique identifier for the folder.
    type: file # Provider type: 'file' means it loads dashboards from files.
    disableDeletion: false # When set to true, Grafana will disable deletion of dashboards from the UI.
    editable: true # When set to true, dashboards can be edited in the UI.
    options:
      # Path to the directory where dashboard JSON files are located.
      # This path is relative to Grafana's dashboards directory (e.g., /var/lib/grafana/dashboards or as configured).
      # In our docker-compose, we mount ./monitoring/grafana/provisioning/dashboards to /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards.
      # So, Grafana will look inside this mounted volume.
      path: /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards
      # For development, you might want Grafana to pick up changes automatically.
      # This is usually enabled by default for file providers.
      # allowUiUpdates: true # If true, dashboards updated in UI will also update the JSON file on disk (requires Grafana >=6.7 and specific permissions)
      #                  # Generally safer to keep this false or unset for provisioned dashboards to maintain version control.
